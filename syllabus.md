## Quantitative Economic Modeling with Data Science Applications

- **Instructor:** Peifan Wu, wupeifan@mail.ubc.ca
- **Textbook:** [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/)


## Course Overview
This is a course introducing the computational and data science tools used in modern economics.

We will apply a programming language (Python) to analyze these sorts of
data and making numerical calculations/simulations of models in economics.

The first four weeks of the classes, up to Feb 7th, will be held virtually on Zoom. According to the current UBC policy, we will meet **in-person** starting from the week of Feb 7th. The classes will be held at **Iona #633** on Mondays and Wednesdays, 8:30am - 9:50am. These schedules will be subject to changes in related UBC policies.

For students who cannot attend in person, class recordings will also be available on Zoom, through http://canvas.ubc.ca.

## COVID-19 Safety

You are required to wear a non-medical mask during our class meetings, for your own protection and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class. For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in-class activities while sharing an indoor space. Non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths are a primary tool for combating the spread of COVID-19. Further, according to the provincial mandate, masks are required in all indoor public spaces including lobbies, hallways, stairwells, elevators, classrooms, and labs. There may be students who have medical accommodations for not wearing a mask. Please maintain a respectful environment.

## UBC values and policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here (https://senate.ubc.ca/policiesresources-support-student-success)
