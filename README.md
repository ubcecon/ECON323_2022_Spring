# Course materials for ECON323 Fall 2021

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful, but **not required**.  We will also talk about the applications of the econometric and statistical learning methods.

We will follow the [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/) textbook

## Computational Setup

Installing software on your laptop is not mandatory. Instead,
- Go to the [QuantEcon DataScience Introduction](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/)
- One-time setup: click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of a lecture and choose the server: ubc.syzygy.ca
- Then click on the "Launch Notebook" to launch any notebook in your computing environment
- See [Troubleshooting](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/troubleshooting.html) for how to reset notebooks, etc.
- We strongly suggest creating a GitHub account and signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/)

You are also encouraged to install Python (preferably Anaconda) on your machines.

If possible, please bring a laptop to class to interactively discuss the material.
